# CR10Slic3rProfiles
Slic3r Profiles for Creality CR10 series of printers

This is just a bunch of tested settings for Creality CR10 printer family.
Please feel free to test, feedback, contribute or criticise.

Installing
----------
1. Install the latest build of Slic3r - I will always use the current released version (not the nightly builds)
2. Click file and import config bundle
3Part of the test is to get the best slicing possible, so for now I won't publish my gcode.

4. For now I am just putting settings for the CR10 mini. I will copy into versions for the bigger printers as I test each setting.

Guidelines
----------
I have tested only with Smartfil PLA. In coming weeks I will test Prusa PLA, Creality own PLA, PET from Rigid Ink and Innofil, Philament UK and at least 2 colours of Steelman's Matteforge.

Testing Objects
---------------
Please use the standard "Marvin" test object from Thingiverse.
Part of the test is to get the best slicing possible, so for now I won't publish my gcode.
